# Sakura Talk - Logo Design Guide

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Based on 2026 logo design best practices and research into minimalist, culturally meaningful brand identity.

---

## Concept: "Blooming Connection"

### Visual Metaphor

The logo represents the personal connection between **guide** (Sammy) and **guest** (you) through the universal symbol of sakura (cherry blossoms).

```
Left Petal (Sakura Pink) = Guest
     +
Right Petal (Matcha Green) = Guide
     ↓
Connection Point = Shared moment
     ↓
Central Blossom = Meaningful conversation & experience
```

### Design Elements

1. **Two Main Petals**
   - **Left (Sakura gradient)**: Represents the guest - warm, welcoming, pink tones
   - **Right (Matcha gradient)**: Represents the guide - knowledgeable, grounded, green tones
   - **Connection point**: Where they meet - the moment of connection

2. **Central Blossom (5 petals)**
   - Represents the full sakura flower
   - Symbolizes the complete, meaningful experience
   - Five petals = traditional Japanese aesthetic (完全/kanzen = completeness)

3. **Color Symbolism**
   - **Sakura Pink (#F2B5C4)**: Warmth, openness, beauty, spring, new beginnings
   - **Matcha Green (#4A6741)**: Wisdom, nature, growth, Japanese tradition
   - **Gold center (#D4A574)**: Value, authenticity, warmth

## Cultural Significance

### Sakura (桜) in Japanese Culture

- **Fleeting beauty**: Cherry blossoms bloom for only 1-2 weeks
- **Cherishing the moment**: The concept of mono no aware (物の哀れ)
- **Connection**: Hanami (花見) brings people together
- **Renewal**: Spring, new beginnings, fresh perspectives

### Design Connection to Service

Just as cherry blossoms bloom briefly but leave lasting memories, Sakura Talk creates **meaningful moments** of connection that guide your journey in Japan.
